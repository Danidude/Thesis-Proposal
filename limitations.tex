\chapter{Limitations and key assumptions}
\label{ch:limitations}

%1-2 pages
%Fits into the method chapter in the thesis.
%Make it clear what you will not do.
%Make it clear what you need to assume to carry out your
%master thesis.

%Limitation: Example
%Applying NN algorithms to governmental web sites.
%Not personal web sites.
%Not business web sites.
%Modelling the development cycle in mobile software developments.
%Not application development.
%Not deployment.

%Assumptions: Example
%Assume that a web site can be modelled as a graph with
%nodes and vertices.
%Assume that wireless data can be modelled using statistics.
%Assume that useful data can be collected from the network
%using sniffer applications.

%Wrong assumptions
%Assume that I will answer my problem deffinitions. 
%Assume that I will prove my hypthesis.

We will limit ourselves to testing and modifying algorithms.
Not creating completely new algorithms.
Not create a fully fleshed out system that would distribute the
safest paths to the passengers.
Not creating the application that would run on the passenger's smartphones.

We will apply current knowledge of human behavior during crisis.
We will apply current knowledge on evacuation considering the occupant density around exits.
Not expand on current knowledge in either fields.

We asume a ship can be sufficently modeled as a graph with nodes and vertices. 
We asume that human behavior in a crisis can be realisticly modeled and
predicted. We asume that hazards can be modeled.
