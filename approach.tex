We will be doing design research by extending algoritms and doing empirical simulations. 
We will collect statistical data on how many people survive the simulations
using different algorithms and different modifications of the algorithms and
running the simulations a sufficient amount of times until the data converges.
Additionally we will test the complexity of the algorithms.
The algorithms will be run against random graphs and fixed graphs.
