We will collect statistical data on how many people survive the simulations
using different algorithms and different modifications of the algorithms and
running the simulations a sufficient amount of times to see a clear pattern.
Additionally we will test the complexity of the algorithms.
The algorithms will be run against random graphs and fixed graphs.
