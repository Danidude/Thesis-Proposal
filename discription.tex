%chapter in your master thesis.

The master thesis will contain 4 chapters: Introduction, Methods, Results and Conclusion.
The introduction will start by broadly describing the thesis in simple terms, then explain the motivation behind the project,
the goal of the thesis, the current state of the art and finally the problem statement. 
The Methods chapter will describe the methods we have used in our research, why we used them and what makes
our research different from the current state of the art. Furthermore, the methods chapter will contain the hypothesis.
The Results chapter will present the results and the evidence that either supports or oppose our hypothesis.
The Discussion will look at what the data means, whether it matters or not and how it compares to other research in the field.
Additionally it will discuss how successful the project has been and if ACO is better than conventional algorithms, as we hypothesized.
