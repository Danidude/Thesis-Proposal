Every year people die from accidents out on the sea on board ships, and as good as the evacuation plans may be now, they will need improvement, as the only acceptable outcome is no casualties. However this may be impossible to achieve in some situations. This project will work on modifying an existing algorithm that will find the safest path from A to B during a crisis, and help save lives during the crisis that otherwise may have been lost. Using Ant Colony Organization which finds a path through the environment to the desired destination, it does so by sending out “ants” that run randomly around until they find the destination and report back on the path they took, then the next “ant”.  In this thesis we will use Dijkstra's to compare it with ACO, as Dijkstra's is one of the most commonly used path finding algorithms today, it may be call it a smart brute force, as it checks every way until the first solution is found, as this will be the shortest path to the desired destination. However in a crisis, the shortest path may not be the best path, therefore we want to use ACO.
