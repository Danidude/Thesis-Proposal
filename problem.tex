Our goal is to evaluate several algorithms and determine which algorithm will provide us with the
best route between two points in dynamic graphs with nodes and vertices. Our main hypothesis
is that Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) will perform better than conventional pathfinding
algorithms. Performance is measured by how many passengers survive the crisis situation
and how efficient the algorithms are.

Secondly, we hypothesise that ACO will perform better than djikstra's pathfinding algorithm
given a continously changing graph. In a real crisis the

Thirdly, we hypothesise that ACO will perform better than djikstra's pathfinding algorithm
given high occupant density around exits.

Finally, we hypothesise that ACO will perform better than djikstra's pathfinding algorithm
by adding human behaviour.
