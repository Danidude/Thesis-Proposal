% Problem definition should never be vague.

The problem that we will solve is which algorithm will provide us with the best route between 
two points in a dynamic graphs with nodes and vertices, both randomly created graphs and 
graphs that will model a ship.

Our hypothesis is that ACO will outperform other conventional pathfinding algorithms
in this scenario. The primary criterion of performance is how many humans survive and
the secondary criterion is how efficient the algorithms are.

We hypothesise that ACO will perform better than djikstra's pathfinding algorithm
given a continously changing graph.

We hypothesise that ACO will perform better than djikstra's pathfinding algorithm
given high occupant density around exits.

We hypothesise that ACO will perform better than djikstra's pathfinding algorithm
by adding human behaviour.
