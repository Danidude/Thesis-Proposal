%How well Ant Colony Optimization can find a proper path during a crisis situation compared to other conventional pathfinding algorithms. 

We will make improvements to already existing pathfinding algorithms that can be used to find a path 
for passengers evacuating a ship. Given that our hypothesis is proven
correct our then modified version of ACO will outperform conventional pathfinding algorithms in our 
specific scenario. This in turn could have wider applications as there are multiple scenarios
where finding a path is subject to change. 

We will determine how human behaviour and occupant density around exits affects path finding algorithms.
It is easy to imagine how a panic around an evacuation bottleneck will become dangerous and slow
down the rate of egress even further than it normaly would. We will attempt to find ways to redirect
evacuees before the issue occurs or, failing that, we will calculate the optimal way to solve the problem.
